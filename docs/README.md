You might be asking yourself, "where are the docs?"
Or maybe, "why is there a python script?"

This is kind of dumb, but this is the quickest way I could find how to do this.

Run the pyhton script, it makes a bash script. 
Then run the bash script.
The bash script calls pydoc a lot to make html documentation.
The wiki is useful for conceptual references, and these docs are more useful for reference.
